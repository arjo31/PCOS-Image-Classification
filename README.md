# PCOS-Image-Classification
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which the ovaries produce an abnormal amount of androgens, male sex hormones that are usually present in women in small amounts. 
• Built several CNN models like Lenet Model, custom models and implemented transfer learning from pretrained models
like InceptionV4, Resnet, and custom made Inception layer modules to train the images.
• Achieved an accuracy of around 76% - 83%. Minimized the recall (false negatives) of the model significantly.
• Working on improving the accuracy by implementing HuggingFace Vision Transformers.
